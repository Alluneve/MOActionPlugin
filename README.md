# MOAction (mo' comfy)
This plugin removes the need to use macros for mouseover. Thanks to Meli and goat as always.

## About
MOAction is a plugin to allow for abilities to be used while mousing over entities. If you've ever played WoW, this is effectively one of their mouseover macros. If you've ever tried to use a mouseover macro in XIV, you know how painful and clunky it is. This plugin removes the clunk associated with macros and creates seamless ability queuing for anything mouseover. No more awkward swapping to party list to heal someone or buff them, no more macros that don't go off half the time.

## Installation
* Unzip the most recently released zip file inside of `%appdata%/XIVLauncher/installedPlugins`, or use the quick launcher's built-in plugin installer.
## In-game usage
* Type `/pmoaction` to pull up a GUI for editing allowed mouseover actions.
  * "Field mouseover" refers to placing your mouse over something's character model on your screen.
  * "GUI mouseover" refers to placing your mouse over something's name on your UI (party list, enmity list).
* Use the abilities!
